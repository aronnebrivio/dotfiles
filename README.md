# ⚙️ Dotfiles
> It seems that after years without *git-ing* my dotfiles, I finally made up my mind! 🎉

After cloning this repo, run `./install` to automatically set up the development environment. Note that the install script is idempotent: it can safely be run multiple times.

Dotfiles uses [Dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) for installation.
